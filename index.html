				<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
				<blockquote>“In a time of national gridlock where municipalities increasingly need to be the driving force for creative problem-solving and innovation, it’s critical to have a nimble organization like Code for America working directly with cities to develop new solutions and accelerate our progress. Our Fellows will be helping to expand data-based decision-making in our schools to improve outcomes for our students, and we are honored that we were selected to host them.” - Mayor Joseph Curtatone </blockquote>

				<h2>Team Somerville Story</h2>

				<p><b><i>“Be abnormal and untethered.”</i></b> These were the words of advice from Mayor Joseph Curtatone. It was our first day of February Residency and we were snowed in. Despite having two Chicagoans on Team Somerville, we were not quite prepared for Boston’s frigid welcome. When our city partners - Stephanie Hirsch and Denise Taylor - arrived at our door, with a spare pair of boots to rescue what they called “LA slippers”, we half expected they would come with skis. </p>

				<p>While many of our scheduled meetings were cancelled due to the State, City and school closures, the eventual record-breaking winter blizzards were blessings in disguise. We adapted and, in many ways, bonded over the shared new experiences: February Fellowship and <a href="https://twitter.com/BostonGlobe/status/577484658105020417">#BOSnow</a> storm. With State and City offices closed, we met our key partners in more impromptu and casual settings: at their homes and at cafes. Stephanie opened her home as our temporary meeting space and, while her four children played inside on their snow day home, we shared our visions for the Fellowship, specifically around the much-spoken “Integrated Data System”. Using her children’s crayons and markers, we drew drawings of what the “Integrated Data System” vision was: students, data, and insights. Even little Joey, Stephanie’s youngest child, joined in with his Big Hero Beymax drawings. We also soon discovered that Stephanie’s home was a revolving door for neighborhood folks who stopped by to simply say hi or to drop off their child for a play date. We immediately saw through these interactions how close-knit a community Somerville is with neighbors opening doors to each other when in need.</p>

				<p>As a Team of Three, we also had to quickly calibrate with each other's daily schedules and habits. We had been primed to prepare for the possibility that residency might mirror “Real World”, living and working 24/7 with now roommates/teammates who only a month ago were strangers. Our “reality” however was much more like Golden Girls. We spent afternoons working from our kitchen table, out of the local Diesel Cafe, or at our Cummings School office. For lunch, we tried out new local restaurants or ate our packed PB&amp;J sandwiches. In the evenings, tea-briefs, home-cooked greens, and board games became our daily rituals. From our morning standups to our evening tea-briefs, for the 28 days of residency, we had each other to lean on, learn from, and laugh with.</p>

				<p>It was not all snowflakes and apple spice tea though. There were inevitable emotional and practical setbacks to not being able to do what we planned on doing: cancellations, postponements, and closures compounded with each inch of snow. But by the end of our February residency, we had shoveled our way through the figurative and literal 64.8 total inches and we had met over 50 stakeholders at the State, City, and schools.</p>

				<p>We spoke with Vince McKay, Assistant Superintendent of Somerville Public Schools, and Uri Harel, Elementary Curriculum Coordinator, and learned how teachers needed a way to better connect disparate data sources together in order to help them monitor student learning and support their instruction. The urgency of tapping into these data was described not simply as a way to mine numbers but to meet individual student needs: <i>“Let’s not collect data and sit on it for months but rapid response to what students need and re-teach”</i> (Uri Harel). We heard stories from Regina Bertholdo on how the Parent Information Center (PIC) is not only the “octopus” that helps families connect with school and social services but as the helping hand that teaches families how to be empowered and advocate for themselves.</p>

				<h2>Somerville: The All-American City</h2>

				<p>Somerville is a small yet bustling city with a population of 78,814 within only 4.1 square miles (Census ACS 2013). With 19,120 people per square mile, Somerville is ranked as one of the most densely populated cities in the country. Experiencing rapid gentrification over the past three decades, Somerville is a melting pot of young and old, local-born and new immigrants, blue-collar families and college students. This diversity is apparent as you walk down the streets from Square to Square. Turn the corner and you will smell the aromas of Brazilian churrasco, Creole goat stew, and Nepalese dal bhat. Sit down at the local cafe and you might overhear conversations about “How can I find childcare?” to “How do I fund my startup?”, spoken in one of the 50+ represented languages.</p>
				
				<p>Awarded the title of All-American City for the third time this year, Somerville has many distinctions to be proud of. Not only is Somerville home to many cultures, it is also a hub of professional diversity with the highest number of analysts per capita in the country and second only to New York in the number of artists per capita. Somerville also benefits from Tufts, Harvard and MIT nearby: <i>“Somerville City Hall attracts the brightest minds and runs like a cross between a startup, a think tank and a fervent nonprofit.”</i></p>

				<p>Over the past 10 years, Mayor Curtatone has developed Somerville into a beacon of innovation, leading the way for smart government and civic engagement. With programs like SomerStat, ResiStat, SomerPromise, and SomerViva, the city has dedicated itself to understanding the needs of all its residents through culturally inclusive dialogue and data-driven insights. In particular, Mayor Curtatone has led the initiatives to use data in decision-making with the belief that “operating without data is like … driving a car blindfold”.</i></p>
